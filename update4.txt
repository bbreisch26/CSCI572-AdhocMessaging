(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
Last sunday we integrated the backend of our app with the frontend. During this week we continued with development now that we could 
test our backend functionality on actual hardware. Using a spare android device and Luke's android phone we began to test the 
WifiP2p API functionality. Currently, we've been able to discover possible peer devices but are having trouble getting both androids 
to discover each other. This puts us slightly behind our initial milestones but we're still making good progress. One of the andorid
devices has the app working and we're diagnosing why the second device is encountering issues.

(2) Each team member's contribution:
Michael Alvarez: I met with the rest of the team on Tuesday and Thursday as we worked through live testing. Together we diagnosed 
issues and fixed them as we got closer to full functionality. Specifically I helped integrate our backend code into the frontend and 
also set up the service broadcast functionality that will allow different devices running this app to detect each other.
