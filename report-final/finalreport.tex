\section{Introduction}
% Motivate the problem;
% Define/formulate the problem: assumptions, application requirements, goals and non-goals;
If someone wants to send a message to a friend nearby, the message must travel much farther than the distance between devices. Messages sent through SMS or Apple's iMessage must travel from the originating device through a series of intermediate infrastructure nodes before reaching the destination device. This causes increased latency and unnecessary network overhead. In an increasingly connected (and congested) world - why bother wasting bandwidth on a message to a nearby device that can be sent directly from peer to peer? We aim to solve this issue by proposing and developing a peer-to-peer messaging app for Android using Wi-Fi Direct for multi-hop ad-hoc networking. An application of this nature has far-reaching applications from messaging and networking at an event or conference to emergency communication during a natural disaster. Although security is always an issue with wireless communication, that is out of the scope of this project. The table below shows some preliminary requirements for this proposed solution.

\section{Related work}
%\item What has been done before?
%\item How does your solution compare to them?

\subsection{AirDrop}

When it comes to ad hoc networking on mobile devices, AirDrop is probably the most widespread application. It supports sending files to nearby devices, without requiring devices to be connected to the same network. AirDrop operates using both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \cite{AppleSupport}.

We aim to differ from this product in several regards:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We primarily aim to support messaging. Having file sharing as a back end is a possible implementation to build messaging on, but would need to be extended.
    \item AirDrop uses iCloud services in order to authenticate users \cite{AppleSupportSecurity}, and additionally only works on Apple devices. We aim to create a de-centralized version that
          could theoretically be deployed on any platform (although we are only developing the application for Android in the scope of this project).
    \item AirDrop uses a combination of point-to-point WiFi connections and bluetooth. We aim to only use Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi / Wi-Fi Direct in our implementation. We realize that the technology choice restricts what devices we can connect with (Apple does not support Wi-Fi direct).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Warpinator}

Warpinator is a file sharing system devloped by the Linux Mint team in order to create an AirDrop like file-sharing system for non-Apple users  \cite{Webster2023linuxmint}. It operates over
LAN, and supports Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux, and could likely be easily ported to other Unix like systems.

We aim to differ from this product in two regards:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As in AirDrop, we primarily aim to support messaging
    \item Operate using ad-hoc networking to support messaging. Warpinator requires a connection to an existing routed network, and can not operate its own ad-hoc network.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Android Beam}
Android beam is a discontinued \cite{Cantisano_2022} feature in Android that allowed data to be transfered over NFC \cite{AndroidDevelopers}. Unlike the prior two works, Android Beam did not only support file
transfer, and was an open interface that applications could use to communicate. Android Beam could provide a reasonable interface for a similar application as ours
to communicate with, if it were not discontinued and limited to NFC.

We aim to differ from this product in two regards:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We aim to use WiFi technologies, rather than NFC, due to the short range limitation of NFC.
    \item We are creating an application, rather than an open interface to communicate over.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A Totally Decentralized Document Sharing System for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks}
This paper  \cite{10.1145/1164783.1164805} presents an application for sharing documents in MANETS. The application presented
is completely unreliant on any form of centralized server or routing algorithms. Documents can be shared in atomic components to different groups
of nodes, and nodes can modify parts of a document, sharing a tree of the modifications. This application achieves a lot of what we are trying to
do, except with more routing and versioning complexity than we are seeking. Our goal is simple messaging and possible document sharing with nearby
nodes, not necessarily using MANET routing algorithms.

We aim to differ from this product in two regards:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Our solution aims to target simple messaging and file sharing, rather than the complex sharing and versioning that the application in the paper presents.
    \item We don't intend to use novel or extremely complex routing algorithms such as those used in MANETS, our goal is short range communications within the range of phone antennas however it may be achieved.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Wi-Fi Direct Research - Current Status and Future Perspectives}
This paper  \cite{WifiDirect} provides an overview of the state of WiFi direct research as of 2017. This doesn't provide an application so
much as a overview of the network architecture, and the systems in place for device discovery, service discovery, group formation,
power saving, and security, all of which we anticipate being of some relevance to our implementation of this final project.

The paper also discusses applications of WiFi direct, including file transfer and emergency communication, which are directly relevant
to our end goal. It also discusses briefly the usage of WiFi direct in FireChat, which was an application that
used wireless mesh networking for peer to peer messaging over bluetooth or WiFi.

\section{Approach} %(optional)
%    \item Rationale: Why is it a good idea?
%     \item Sketch of your approach and design.
Mobile app development, especially for Android, has an extremely wide range of resources on the Internet. The Android platform is well supported by the community and we plan to leverage many online resources for the development of this app. Android provides an existing Wi-Fi Direct library that we use to speed up development. This app was developed using Android's Studio Software Development Kit in Kotlin. For our mobile app to function properly, we used mock-ups of different pages and screens. In the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) field, these are called wireframes. We created three wireframes, each showing the sign-in page, nearby users, and the messaging page of the application respectively. The wireframes were created in a free tool called WonderShare and are shown in the image below. These wireframes will guide development of the user interface.\\
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{wireframe.png} \\
\end{center}
Behind the scenes, this application uses a complex set of functions and internal storage structures. Devices  periodically broadcast beacon frames with routing information, tagged with usernames for each device. When the app is open on a device, it will listen for these beacon frames and update its list of nearby users accordingly. When a message is sent to a peer device, we use TCP for the best reliability. Conversations between users are stored on the device.

\section{Implementation}
As stated earlier in this report, the Ad-Hoc Messaging app was implemented in Kotlin using Android Studio. During development, we discovered that our app requires certain permissions to be given by the device owner. In order to ensure the proper permissions were granted, we added a fourth screen to the UI layout. This permission screen is shown to the user on startup if the app is lacking any permissions. This aids in development as a sanity check that any issues we run into are not permission-related.
\subsection{Front-End}
The front end was developed using the composable model, reusable units of code that compile into visual elements.
There are four separate screens on the app. 
\subsubsection{Permission Screen}
The permission screen is shown at the end of this section. This screen is fairly simple. It shows a message that lets the user know that the app is missing the correct permissions. At the bottom of the page, there is a button that users can click on to be taken to the Android OS permission screen for the app. All users need to do is allow the correct permissions and go back to the app in order to be taken to the sign-in screen.
\subsubsection{Sign-In Screen}
The sign-in screen is shown at the end of this section. Users are presented with the AI-generated logo for this app as well as a text-box to input their desired username. After entering a username, the user can click the sign-in button in order to kick off the back-end processes to start broadcasting frames and looking for other devices nearby.
\subsubsection{User Screen}
After a user clicks the sign-in button on the sign-in screen, many of the backend services are started. Once the back-end processes discover a nearby device running the app, the process adds the discovered device to the UI. The user can select the device in order to initiate a Wi-Fi Direct connection and transition to the chat screen.
\subsubsection{Chat Screen}
Opening the chat screen for a discovered device requires the Wi-Fi Direct connection to be opened and error-free. Users are presented with the local chat history, pulled from the MongoDB database. Users can type and send new messages at any time while inside the chat screen. If a message is successfully sent, the contents will populate as a sent message in the UI. If the message does not successfully send, the user is notified and not added to the database.

\subsubsection{Service Advertisement}
\subsubsection{Connection Protocol}
\subsubsection{Message Storage}

\subsection{Multihop}
While our initial proposal set out requirements for multi-hop routing and creating a mesh network, we determined early on that this is not feasible. Because we are restricted to using Android's Wi-Fi Direct API, it would not make sense to do multi-hop routing using Wi-Fi Direct. We found that the association latency to connect between clients is much too slow in order to accommodate any kind of mesh networking.



\section{Performance Evaluation}
%      \item What experiments are you going to run?
\subsection{Scenarios}

We performed all of our evaluation and experimentation on live android smart phones. One of our team members had a spare Wi-Fi Direct compatible android phone and we acquired one more 


One of our team members has an android device and we are currently investigating how to emulate more android devices or acquire dummy devices for experimentation. To gain a full picture of our application's performance we plan to test it in the following scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Single-hop communication
    \item Multi-hop communication
    \item New user event
    \item Dropping user event
    \item High pace usage
    \item File messages
    \item Low distance
    \item Maximum distance
\end{itemize}

The single-hop communication experiments will be performed with two devices which will have a single connection between them. The multi-hop communication experiments will use at least three devices and test the routing capabilities of the app. We will also test how quickly our solution can adapt to topology changes such as users opening the app or closing the app. That in particular is especially important since people are rarely just using a single app continuously. Typical users will flip quickly between several different apps while using their phone or device. Additionally, we will test the impact of high paced usage on network performance. Some users send messages back and forth as fast as their fingers can type and even do that with multiple different contacts. Most messaging apps also allow for users to send each other multimedia messages or files such as photos and videos. So that capability will be tested as well. Finally, it is always important to study how the physical environment will impact performance. So we will run these experiments at a close distance range and then push it as high as we can go. All of these scenarios will be combined into an array of experiments that we can use to fully capture the performance of our app.

%   \item What criteria and metrics are you going to use to evaluate your solutions?
\subsection{Metrics}

For each experiment we will record the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Throughput
    \item Latency
    \item Packet loss rate
\end{itemize}
The throughput in this case is simply the data transmission rate throughout the whole network. So, all of the messages sent and received over time measured in data per second. The latency has multiple components that will each need to be analyzed individually as well as together. For example, there is latency from route acquisition, processing, potential queuing, transmission, propagation, re-transmission, etc. We will attempt to record as many of the individual components as possible. Finally, the packet loss rate is simply the rate at which a packet transmission fails and a re-transmission is required.

\subsection{Criteria}

There are two key results we are looking for by performing these experiments. The first is comparing our app to other existing solutions. We want to see if our approach of using WiFi-Direct performs better or worse than the approaches detailed in the related work section. Furthermore, we want to analyze specific areas and metrics so as to conclude the pros and cons of the different technologies. The second result is if our solution meets the user's needs. Does it have the necessary throughput, latency, and reliability to provide a good experience for the casual user? That result will tell us whether or not our solution is usable and functional for the problem.

The criteria for our first result is fairly straightforward. We will simply compare our recorded metrics directs against the best existing solution we can find. This will allow us to compare and contrast the different approaches directly. On the other hand, the criteria for our second result is much less straightforward. There is no benchmark for the minimum performance required on a messaging app. So we will evaluate the app against our own defined criteria of what is needed for a "good user experience".

These soft criteria are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Able to handle constant activity, fast paced messaging between multiple pairs of users.
    \item Scales to a large number of users, at least 10 in a small area.
    \item Low latency
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Less than one second for text messages
              \item Less then ten seconds for files, pictures, or videos
          \end{itemize}
    \item Reliable delivery, data gets delivered unless destination is unreachable.
\end{itemize}
These are the basic requirements for any messaging app to be useful. If any one of these are missing then the user experience is miserable.
A messaging app needs to keep up with even the fastest typer. We can put a character limit to restrict total message size, but that wouldn't stop a user from sending many large messages in quick succession. Therefore, it is important that the app can handle such usage. One speedy user shouldn't be able to cause network delay. We will need to find out how fast a person can send out messages and then use that as a throughput threshold for app speed.

Scalability is the next concern. If users can't send or receive messages in a crowded environment then the app is not very useful. Settings such as a school, apartment complex, or office may have many participating users trying to use the app at once. More participating devices in the network obviously increases the total network bandwidth, but does that increase in bandwidth outpace the increase in required throughput? We don't have the equipment required to test a truly large scale deployment of our app, but we can still analyze the impact of more participating devices. Then by weighing the increase in both bandwidth and throughput, we can estimate how well the application will scale.

Since our app sends messages locally to a destination, rather than traveling through a complex network of infrastructure nodes, users will expect it to be very quick. Therefore, low latency is also a requirement. Nobody likes to wait for something as simple as a message to send. Especially when some conversations are time sensitive. So the text messages themselves should send very quickly, with a small wait required for larger files.
Finally, messages need to be delivered. When a user sends a message they expect it to actually reach the destination. If that promise isn't upheld then that can cause confusion and frustration amongst users. If the destination is unreachable then the sending user needs to be alerted of this. This is a potential problem for our app as users could be hopping on and off the app at a rapid pace.
