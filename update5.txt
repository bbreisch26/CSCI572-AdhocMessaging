(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
Thanksgiving week up to today we have come much closer to what we originally envisioned for our app.
We've been working very closely as a group to get past obstacles provided by the hardware and support
for Wifi-Direct capability. Currently we have the app working on two phones with an established 
connection between them. They're able to send messages back and forth while we finalize the UI and 
data storage of recieved/sent messages. We haven't started collecting quantitative results or writing 
the report so we're still a little behind schedule but trying to catch up with the time we have left.

(2) Each team member's contribution:

Michael Alvarez: I met with the rest of the team last Tuesday and Today as we worked through more live 
testing. Together we diagnosed issues and fixed them as we achieved more and more functionality. 
Specifically, I worked heavily with Ben on debgugging the connection and socket code that allows for messages
to be sent between the devices running the app. The biggest issues being caused by hardware incompatability
and discovering peer devices IP addresses after the Wifi-Direct Group has been initialized. I'm also starting 
to prepare for how we can run experiments to test the performance of our application.

Ben Breisch: We met as a team last week on Tuesday and today so that we could work on the app implementation.
We discovered that the low-cost Blu phone I had purchased for the project was not actually compatible with WiFi p2p.
I went out and procured a Google Pixel 7a phone, which has been phenomenal. I have completed most of the work on
the backend and front end, being the only person with a working test set up. This week we aim to conduct experiments
and collect data.
