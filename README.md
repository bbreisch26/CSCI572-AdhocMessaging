# CSCI572Project - Team 1: Ad-Hoc Messaging App

## Overview

If someone wants to send a message to a friend nearby, the message must travel much farther than the distance between devices. Messages sent through SMS or Apple's iMessage must travel from the originating device through a series of intermediate infrastructure nodes before reaching the destination device. This causes increased latency and unnecessary network overhead. In an increasingly connected (and congested) world - why bother wasting bandwidth on a message to a nearby device that can be sent directly from peer to peer? 

We aim to solve this issue by proposing and developing a peer-to-peer messaging app for Android using Wi-Fi Direct for multi-hop ad-hoc networking. An application of this nature has far-reaching applications from messaging and networking at an event or conference to emergency communication during a natural disaster. Although security is always an issue with wireless communication, that is out of the scope of this project.
