(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
This week we continued application development. The frontend UI for the app is nearly finished and much of the structure 
for the Wi-Fi P2P messaging backend is working. We are meeting on Sunday in-person to integrate the backend with the frontend.
We aim to get a version working on two Android devices within a week, which lines up with our milestone of 11/15. We have created the 
final report document and aim to start writing once the implementation is done. We look to test and verify our design once we have it
deployed to physical devices.

Michael Alvarez: 

Ben Breisch: I worked on the frontend UI this week. I learned how to create the UI in Android's Jetpack Compose, something I've never used before.
The structure of the UI is done and the only thing left is to style it better and integrate the buttons and different screens with the backend code.
