(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
    As a team we collectively investigated existing Android apps like Warpinator (that was part of our related work section) 
which used different wireless protocols. We wanted to see if we could take the UI and other code but just substitute 
WiFi-Direct as the networking component of the app. We also investigated the Android WiFi Direct (peer-to-peer or P2P)
API. Additionally, we all installed the Android SDK, Android Studio.

    After looking into Warpinator we have decided to pivot and instead create our own application while using the existing
solutions as references.

Our original milestones say that we should already have completed our initial implementation, but we realize in retrospect that
was perhaps too optimistic. So we are behind on our milestones but still making good progress.

(2) Each team member's contribution:
Michael Alvarez: I investigated Warpinator and what sections of the code depend on its current WiFi protocol for 
transferring files. I determined that changing Warpinator to fit our needs would take a lot of work. So I pivoted
and began to look at other existing solutions for reference on how we could structure our own solution. I found several
open source projects that we can look at in the next steps of our process.
