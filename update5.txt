(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
Thanksgiving week up to today we have come much closer to what we originally envisioned for our app.
We've been working very closely as a group to get past obstacles provided by the hardware and support
for Wifi-Direct capability. Currently we have the app working on two phones with an established 
connection between them. They're able to send messages back and forth while we finalize the UI and 
data storage of recieved/sent messages. We haven't started collecting quantitative results or writing 
the report so we're still a little behind schedule but trying to catch up with the time we have left.
