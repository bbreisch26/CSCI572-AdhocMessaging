(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
This week we started doing application development. We are continuing to work on getting the skeleton of the app set
up, and aim to have that done by next week. This week we laid a lot of good groundwork in the front and back end of
the application but now we need to start hooking the pieces together and test on live hardware since the emulator
doesn't work with testing WiFi-Direct related functionality.

We are still behind our original milestones but feel that this is good progress nontheless.

(2) Each team member's contribution:
Michael Alvarez: I set up the base skeleton for initializing the WiFi P2P Manager (Aka WiFi-Direct) which is the API 
that handles calls for discovering peers and connecting to them. Currently all it does is initialize and then attempt
to discover neighbors. Additionally, I added some skeleton code for the client and server sides of a data tranfer.


Ben Breisch: I have started the implementation of the front-end UI using Jetpack Compose. This is built into Android Studio
and performs better than XML-based layouts. It is also much easier to develop Jetpack UIs compared to the traditional XML.
I have not pushed any updates since it is a work in progress but I am done with one out of the three pages and almost done
with the second page. Next week will focus on finishing the UI and hooking it up to logic added by Luke and Michael.

Luke Beukelman: I've continues to look into WiFi direct in Android, and have started to add bits and pieces to the application.
