(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
This week we continued application development. The frontend UI for the app is nearly finished and much of the structure 
for the Wi-Fi P2P messaging backend is working. We are meeting on Sunday in-person to integrate the backend with the frontend.
We aim to get a version working on two Android devices within a week, which lines up with our milestone of 11/15. We have created the 
final report document and aim to start writing once the implementation is done. We look to test and verify our design once we have it
deployed to physical devices.

(2) Each team member's contribution:
Michael Alvarez: This week I investigated how we can integrate the backend with the frontend so that we have a plan for when we meet up this
Sunday to hook everything together. The key seems to lie with the idea of interfaces called adapters which contain information to display
on the frontend and also invoke backend functionality. Once we have that in place then we can diagnose any backend issues and create our
working version of the application.

Ben Breisch: I worked on the frontend UI this week. I learned how to create the UI in Android's Jetpack Compose, something I've never used before.
The structure of the UI is done and the only thing left is to style it better and integrate the buttons and different screens with the backend code.

Luke Beukelman: This was still mostly looking into Kotlin and WiFi direct programming. We set up a meeting to hash out the final bits and pieces on Sunday.
