(1) Team progress compared to milestones:
Last sunday we integrated the backend of our app with the frontend. This week we used the class
time to work as a group. We have run the application on two phones, but have not gotten them to 
communicate yet. They have been able to detect other WiFi direct devices, but not each other. 
We found that one of the phone was giving error when initiating the WiFi direct interface, so 
we need to debug that. This puts us slightly behind our initial milestones but we're still making 
good progress.

(2) Each team member's contribution:
Michael Alvarez: I met with the rest of the team on Tuesday and Thursday as we worked through live 
testing. Together we diagnosed issues and fixed them as we got closer to full functionality. 
Specifically I helped integrate our backend code into the frontend and also set up the service 
broadcast functionality that will allow different devices running this app to detect each other.

Ben Breisch:

Luke Beukelman: I wiped my old phone for group usage. The other phone is my present personal phone,
which is the one that is giving us grief. We worked as a group in testing in developing on Tuesday
and Thursday, and I have spent about an additional hour trying to resolve an issue with android studio
where I am unable to debug my phone over a wired connection, only over a wireles communication, which
we think may result in additional trouble to WiFi direct. We ran my personal phone in USB debugging on
Michael's computer and still found it to be giving errors (although rather from being busy, it was a
generic error).
